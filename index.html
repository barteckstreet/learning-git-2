    <h1>Porcupine Bee<br>
    Way out of here</h1>
    <section>
    Out at the train tracks I dream of escape<br>
    But a song comes onto my iPod<br>
    And I realize it's getting late<br>
    </section>
    <section>
    I can't take the staring and the sympathy<br>
    And I don't like the questions,<br>
    "How do you feel?"<br>
    "How's it going in school?"<br>
    "Do you wanna talk about it?"<br>
    </section>
    <section>
    Way out, way out of here<br>
    Fade out,<br>
    Fade out, vanish<br>
    </section>
    <section>
    I'll try to forget you<br>
    And I know that I will<br>
    In a thousand years<br>
    Or maybe a week<br>
    </section>
    <section>
    I'll burn all your pictures<br>
    Cut out your face<br>
    </section>
    <section>
    The shutters are down and the curtains are closed<br>
    And I've covered my tracks<br>
    Disposed of the car<br>
    </section>
    <section>
    And I'll try to forget even your name<br>
    And the way that you look when you're sleeping,<br>
    And dreaming of this<br>
    </section>
    <section>
    Way out, way out of here<br>
    Fade out,<br>
    Fade out, vanish<br>
    </section>
